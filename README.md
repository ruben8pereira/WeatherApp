2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the name of the city in the search input.

## Styling

The app uses CSS for styling, including a keyframe animation for the rotating color effect in the title.

## Weather Icons

Weather icons are displayed based on the weather conditions obtained from the API. Icons include Clear, Clouds, Drizzle, Mist, Rain, and Snow.

## Error Handling

The app handles errors gracefully by displaying an "Invalid City Name" message when the entered city is not found.
